# MazeSolverCar-Arduino..
For school project uses, i think i will simulate with computer first, if icould do that then it will be moving to arduino.


Inspired by an Event called "Micromouse" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse
then i decided to do this project...

My plan:
1) Generate maze with recursive backtracker algorithm (on computer)
2) Try to solve the maze with wall-follower algorithm (on computer)
3) If both 1st and 2nd steps were success, make an arduino controlled car. See if i can did it like "Micromouse"...
