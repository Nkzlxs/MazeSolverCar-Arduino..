# MazeSolverCar-Arduino..
For school project uses, i think i will simulate with computer first, if icould do that then it will be moving to arduino.


Inspired by an Event called "Micromouse" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse

then i decided to do this project...

My plan(steps):
1) Generate maze with recursive backtracker algorithm (on computer,with visual studio community 2017,SFML Library)
2) Try to solve the maze with wall-follower algorithm (on computer,with visual studio community 2017,SFML Library)

3) If i was able to do 1st and 2nd step,then make an arduino controller car that uses wall-follower algorithm to solve maze!
